Abstract
--------
In our final project, we explored robots greeting humans. As robots play an
increasing role in our lives in the future, it will be critical for robots to
engage with humans in a natural, playful way. Robots that do not greet people
will be seen as cold machines. Our belief is that robots that perform
personalized greetings will be treated with greater sympathy and tolerance. Our
system uses face detection to identify the individual and start a personalized
prerecorded handshake using Sawyer, a robotic arm.
