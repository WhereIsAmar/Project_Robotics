Abstract
--------
In our final project, we explored robots greeting humans. Robots will play an
an important role in our daily lives in the future, and it will be critical for
robots to engage with humans in a natural, playful way. Robots that do not
greet people will be seen as cold machines. Our belief is that robots that
perform personalized greetings will be treated with greater sympathy and
tolerance. Our system uses face detection to identify the individual and start
a personalized prerecorded handshake using Sawyer, a robotic arm.

Introduction and Background
---------------------------
Human-robot interaction (HRI) is the study of interactions between humans and
robots. Most human behavior is automatic, unconscious and taken for granted.
Robots are not naturally social and must be designed to adopt social norms in
human environments. Robots that deviate from social behaviors that humans take
for granted can make some people uneasy.

In all cultures, there exist commonly used greetings. Greetings are how humans
acknowledge the presence of each other. Handshakes are a common greeting in
many cultures, and one that can be performed by a robotic arm. Handshakes vary
by culture so it's important to be able to personalize and perform a variety of
shakes.
